# Agentic dispatch handoff

Proposal: pipeline-controller owns first-stage readiness and the merge gate in
agentic mode. Chai owns second-stage execution unless a response timeout or
`/pipeline skip-agentic-mode` hands dispatch back to the traditional workflow.

## Workflow

- After applicable first-stage tests pass, create `ci/pipeline-gate`
  pending (`queued`). Successful readiness dispatch starts a 20-minute wait for Chai.
- Any new comment from a configured Chai author during the wait cancels the response timeout,
  but leaves the gate pending. No message within 20 minutes hands second-stage
  dispatch to the traditional workflow; the gate turns green only after dispatch succeeds.
  No acknowledgement command or HEAD is needed. Old comments do not cancel a new wait;
  late comments do not reclaim dispatch after timeout fallback or opt-out.
- Chai owns second-stage selection and dispatch. It ensures selected job
  contexts block merging before marking the gate; success does not mean
  tests passed. Pipeline-controller neither reads plans nor verifies job lists.
- `/pipeline mark-pipeline-gate [<HEAD>]` completes the active check. Reject a
  supplied HEAD that differs from the current PR HEAD; omitted HEAD targets
  current HEAD when processed. Chai should supply HEAD to avoid repush races.
  New HEAD/base requires fresh readiness and completion.
- `/pipeline skip-agentic-mode` opts this PR into the existing traditional
  auto/manual/LGTM workflow. `/pipeline agentic-mode` restores agentic review
  only when repository/branch configuration permits it, invalidating previous
  completion and issuing a fresh readiness signal once first-stage tests pass.
  Already-agentic PRs receive confirmation only: no gate reset, timer restart or new analysis.
- Persist opt-out as a PR label across pushes/restarts. Mode changes do not
  cancel running jobs; actual mode switches invalidate previous completion.
  Traditional dispatch still completes the renamed check automatically.

## Remove

- Chai plan parsing, job-list validation, frozen selections and review-request correlation.
- Agentic second-stage scheduling, context publication, rerun/delta planning and dispatch-comment deduplication.
- Per-PR JSON journals, schema handling, filesystem locks, retention cleanup,
  disk-backed witnesses, PVC dependency and state-directory/TTL flags.
- Old check/command names, obsolete agentic command handlers and their tests.

## Keep and rollout

Reuse first-stage/ProwJob-cache logic, traditional scheduling, owned-check helpers,
command authorization, trusted-Chai response detection, response timeout and
bounded API retries. Recover through ordinary events and commands; no startup
PR scan or polling. Timers and timeout fallback may be lost on restart (accepted for now).
Owned completion checks and opt-out labels remain; missed events may require another event/rerun.

Update Chai for the new pending-check creation signal and mode handoff. Require
the new check in Tide/branch protection on enrolled branches; retire the old
`ci/tests-dispatched` requirement and pending checks. Update help and deployment flags together.
Remove state-directory/TTL deployment arguments and the unused PVC mount; there are no flag aliases.
Keep one active controller replica with `Recreate`; no leader election is added.
